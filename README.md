# Maraton_Race_Simulator

Designed a multi-threaded program to simulate a race between runners with different speeds and rest times.  The program involved data management using methods to read data from text files, XML files, and the derby database. The program was also interactive, prompting user friendly inputs to determine where to draw the data.
